There's the fact we seem to be getting a bit of a rep for our parties, where we've hosted up to 500 people at one time. For a slightly more intimate feel, try our private wine room with unique wine displays. Then there are the two large patios that look out onto the 16th Street pedestrian mall, one upstairs and one at ground level for two distinctly perfect views of summer. Our private dining room that fits groups of up to 40 for seated dinners or private meetings. Let's not forget the contemporary, fresh Earls menu. The 29 big-screen plasma TVs. The smiles that greet your arrival. The feeling of knowing you made the right choice for a good night out with your family and friends. C'mon, tell us you're not just a little bit tempted?\n\n Come join us at Earls Glenarm right in downtown Denver. We are located just off the corner of 16th Street and Glenarm Place on the southeast side of 16th, next door to Pinkberry's and Cooks Fresh Market. The list of nearby attractions is large, but here are the highlights: the Colorado Convention Center, Coors Field, Pavillions shopping mall with a United Artists Theatre, Denver Art Museum, Sports Authority Field...and more more more. You'll find live music on 16th Street in the summer months, plus art shows, street performers, and of course shopping.

Repurposed and recycled materials are used throughout the space to create an industrial design and comfortable setting that compliments the history of the building. Ace Eat Serve was a recipient of the 2012 Mayor\u2019s Design Award.\n\nThe fun and lively energy of the Ping-Pong hall carries itself to the outdoor Pong tables, picnic tables, and into the dining room. Ace Eat Serve is a different and affordable night out. A drink on the patio, a casual dinner at the Chef\u2019s Counter, and some laughs over a game of Pong combine to make Ace Eat Serve a totally new and unique concept to Denver.\n\nAce Eat Serve serves Asian inspired dishes conducive to sharing, drinking and hanging out.

Situated in the lower downtown (LoDo) community, the restaurant is only blocks from Denver\u2019s main mass transit location, Union Station, and Coors Field, home of the Colorado Rockies, in the celebrated St. Elmo Hotel building. Pair the great food and bar menu with the location, and we\u2019ve created an experience unlike any other around. But don\u2019t just take our word for it. The low key, urban-industrial setting has become a frequent hot spot for local and national celebrities, from NFL players to Grammy winning musicians.\n\nSouthern Hospitality in Denver is the first franchised location of the Southern Hospitality BBQ brand of restaurants based in New York City, and received the Five Star Diamond Award in 2015. The restaurant concept was largely created by Eytan Sugarman and Grammy award winning singer\/songwriter, Justin Timberlake. The ultimate goal was to create a venue to provide guests with fresh, high quality, southern inspired food, complimented by a wide array of popular micro-brews, bottled beers and bourbons, served in a hip and high energy environment. Southern Hospitality brings all of those things, along with great music, service and hospitality to Lone Tree at a whole new level.\n\nSouthern Hospitality Denver is managed by Southern Concepts Restaurant Group (SCRG), which trades under the symbol OTCQB:RIBS. Southern Concepts Restaurant Group was founded by a handful of barbecue enthusiasts who were eager to bring the finest of Southern barbecue to the Southwest region. The Company manages Southern Hospitality Restaurant and Bar, Southern Hospitality Southern Kitchen, and is in the process of launching a fast casual barbecue concept.\n\nFor more information about Southern Concepts Restaurant Group, please visit www.southernconcepts.com.","hours":{"mon_1_open":"11:00","mon_1_close":"23:00","tue_1_open":"11:00","tue_1_close":"23:00","wed_1_open":"11:00","wed_1_close":"23:00","thu_1_open":"11:00","thu_1_close":"23:00","fri_1_open":"11:00","fri_1_close":"00:00","sat_1_open":"10:00","sat_1_close":"00:00","sun_1_open":"10:00","sun_1_close":"22:00"},"price_range":"$$ (10-30)","parking":{"street":1,"lot":1,"valet":1},"cover":{"cover_id":"523433524445610","source":"https:\/\/scontent.xx.fbcdn.net\/hphotos-xfp1\/t31.0-8\/s720x720\/10272692_523433524445610_3743381206342701854_o.jpg","offset_y":80,"offset_x":0},"restaurant_services":{"reserve":1,"walkins":1,"groups":1,"kids":1,"takeout":1,"delivery":1,"catering":1,"waiter":1,"outdoor":1},"restaurant_specialties":{"breakfast":1,"lunch":1,"dinner":1,"coffee":0,"drinks":1},"website":"http:\/\/www.shdenver.com","id":"126356417486658","picture":{"data":{"is_silhouette":false,"url":"https:\/\/fbcdn-profile-a.akamaihd.net\/hprofile-ak-xfa1\/v\/t1.0-1\/c164.50.632.632\/s50x50\/546986_276689655786666_503870682_n.jpg?oh=d451a40a8f092cb539250ada19a6d4cb&oe=563B4CE2&__gda__=1447224786_96584bd21422d7c31869f308e9e79961"}}},{"location":{"street":"1962 E Colfax Ave","city":"Denver","state":"CO","country":"United States","zip":"80206","latitude":39.7398109,"longitude":-104.963829},"name":"Pete's Kitchen (Petie T's)","likes":5080,"talking_about_count":146,"were_here_count":24883,"price_range":"$ (0-10)","parking":{"street":0,"lot":1,"valet":0},"cover":{"cover_id":"10151114977650566","source":"https:\/\/scontent.xx.fbcdn.net\/hphotos-prn2\/v\/t1.0-9\/604044_10151114977650566_559182600_n.jpg?oh=0ab6e2441d70f97af10f92a94b4177f2&oe=5640BBD7","offset_y":14,"offset_x":0},"restaurant_services":{"reserve":0,"walkins":1,"groups":1,"kids":0,"takeout":1,"delivery":0,"catering":0,"waiter":0,"outdoor":0},"restaurant_specialties":{"breakfast":1,"lunch":1,"dinner":1,"coffee":1,"drinks":0},"website":"http:\/\/www.petesrestaurants.com\/PetesKitchen.html","id":"99555845565","picture":{"data":{"is_silhouette":false,"url":"https:\/\/fbcdn-profile-a.akamaihd.net\/hprofile-ak-xaf1\/v\/t1.0-1\/c0.4.50.50\/p50x50\/28402_395809675565_3046509_n.jpg?oh=cec8b0941e1e7976b0a22ce4a0ea1d55&oe=564D9A1C&__gda__=1446956881_c0f89388a36b80dbcd8ab9b8310b36b7"}}},{"location":{"street":"1201 16th St","city":"Denver","state":"CO","country":"United States","zip":"80202","latitude":39.7487411,"longitude":-104.9965897},"name":"Mellow Mushroom Downtown Denver","likes":8371,"talking_about_count":140,"were_here_count":9823,"description":"FEATURES AND EVENTS\n-Full bar and 36 craft beers on tap\n-Beer Club, sign up at the restaurant\n-17 flat-screen televisions\n-Family friendly\n-Late-night kitchen service\n\nHAPPY HOUR: Monday thru Friday 3:30 p.m. to 6:30 p.m. and daily 10 p.m. to close. $2 Coors Light Drafts | $2 Session Lagers | $3 Colorado Drafts | $3 Well Drinks | $3 House Wine | $3 Small Bites\n\nGAME DAYS: During all live professional Colorado sports. $2 domestic bottles including Session | $2 Coors Lights drafts\n\nSUNDAY BRUNCH: Breakfast Pizza, 11 a.m. to 3 p.m. \n\nMONDAY: Half Price Wine Bottles Night, 5 p.m. to close.

Our style of vegan comfort food has won over the hearts and stomachs of people from all types of dietary backgrounds. The greatest compliment we hear (and we hear it often) is when an initially reluctant patron says that they never thought they would eat vegan food, and now WaterCourse is their favorite restaurant.\n\nWaterCourse Food's philosophy, like our food, is simple and accessible.

He loved Colorado and all that it offered,  but always recognized an absence of the unique tacos  and breakfast tacos from back home. After much deliberation he chose to study finance and real estate, and graduated during the peak of the financial crisis. This absence of jobs led him to work at a couple of his Uncle\u2019s restaurants and then to an entrepreneurial venture in real estate. He made just enough money to buy a backpack and a one-way ticket to China to start a seven-month journey that would allow him to accomplish a lifelong dream, stepping foot on all 7 continents. While wandering through the world he fell in love with delicious street foods and flavors and right then he decided he wanted to offer his own delicious foods to all, in the form of his favorite food\u2026tacos. We consider our tacos to be uniquely American in style and taste.\n\nWe hope you will enjoy eating them as much as we have enjoyed finding, creating and testing them.

Our pizza dough is made fresh, shaped by hand and baked directly on a stone deck oven. Pasta sauces take hours to prepare and simmer to perfection. Our meatballs are individually hand-rolled.

The building is intentionally reminiscent of the United States Capitol. Designed by Elijah E. Myers, it was constructed in the 1890s from Colorado white granite, and opened for use in November 1894. The distinctive gold dome consists of real gold leaf, first added in 1908, commemorating the Colorado Gold Rush. The building is part of Denver's Civic Center area. It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places as part of the Civic Center Historic District in 1974, and became part of the Denver Civic Center National Historic Landmark District in 2012.Serving as the beginning of the Capitol Hill district, the historic building sits slightly higher than the rest of downtown Denver. The main entrance hall is open 180 feet (55 m) to the top of the dome, about the height of an 18-story building. Additionally, the official elevation of Denver is measured outside the west entrance to the building, where the fifteenth step is engraved with the words \"One Mile Above Sea Level.\" From this step, at 5280ft, the sun can be seen setting behind the Rocky Mountains. A second mile high marker was set in the 18th step in 1969 when Colorado State University students resurveyed the elevation. In 2003, a more accurate measurement was made with modern means, and the 13th step was identified as being one mile (1.6 km) high, where a 3rd marker was installed.","id":"110055649045685","picture":{"data":{"is_silhouette":false,"url":"https:\/\/fbexternal-a.akamaihd.net\/safe_image.php?d=AQA9AnWP09Rd8H_F&w=50&h=50&url=http\u00253A\u00252F\u00252Fupload.wikimedia.org\u00252Fwikipedia\u00252Fcommons\u00252Fthumb\u00252Fb\u00252Fb0\u00252FColoradocapitolhill2.JPG\u00252F720px-Coloradocapitolhill2.JPG&crop&fallback=hub_likes&prefix=q"}}},{"location":{"street":"","city":"Denver","state":"CO","country":"United

Denver","likes":330,"talking_about_count":7,"were_here_count":165,"description":"We pair your choice of 8 to 12 amazing fresh made soups daily with the best Chef driven gourmet sandwiches and fresh salads. Our signature fresh breads are baked daily, inspired by our zeal to provide you with only the very best of what today's healthy bakers can provide. Your choice, ALWAYS fresh, never frozen, with locally grown produce, and chef picked ingredients to fit your healthy lifestyle.\n\nDuck Soup started as a twinkle in Founder David Fitzgerald's eye in 1997 while operating Colorado ski country's best Bakery-Cafe's. We started making fresh soups in the early days of Clint's Bakery & Coffee House in Breck, Breckenridge's most popular Coffee Shop & Bakery. We started making our own soups because we just plain disliked frozen soups. From a health perspective, all of the essential nutrients of the terrific array of proteins and vegetables are severely dominished, and from a taste perspective, it's just plain awful. David founded and operated a number of Summit County's favorite spots. Summit was a terrific place to cut my teeth and develop some amazing recipes. I'd hire Chefs from some of the country's best schools. New graduates from Hyde Park, New York, Boston, and others would come out to ski for a season before starting their careers. I'd snap them up, and empower them to show off. And the results were amazing. From Watermelon Gazpacho to Hunter's Chili with (elk and pheasant), some of the best recipes we now make came from this period in my early career. \n\nWhat makes Duck Soup even better is the process we use to serve soup. Inspired by today's popular Pho restaurants, we use a 'Quick Assemble' process that ensures that items that typically suffer in the soup making process like pastas and fresh vegetables, are cooked and served to perfection. Unfrozen, cooked al dente, and crispy fresh, nutrient filled veggies, and firm flavourful pastas meet delicious stock seconds before we serve, not days, and the taste difference is unbelievable.\n\nCome try Duck Soup, and experience the difference that thoughtful and expert execution of one of a kind recipes can make to both your health, and your tastebuds!","hours":{"mon_1_open":"10:30","mon_1_close":"19:00","tue_1_open":"10:30","tue_1_close":"19:00","wed_1_open":"10:30","wed_1_close":"19:00","thu_1_open":"10:30","thu_1_close":"19:00","fri_1_open":"10:30","fri_1_close":"19:00"},"price_range":"$

It resembles a cash register or mailbox and is known locally as the \"Cash Register Building\" or the \"Mailbox Building\". It is 698ft high, the third tallest building in Denver. It is shorter than the Republic Plaza building 714ft and the CenturyLink Tower, at 709ft. The building sits on a hill, making its overall elevation higher than the two taller buildings, but its ground-to-roof height is less. It is 52 stories tall.The building was designed by architect Philip Johnson and was completed in 1983. As it was originally designed for a downtown area in Texas, a heated roof is necessary to prevent snow from accumulating and sliding dangerously off the curved crown. Located at 1700 Lincoln Street, a skybridge over Lincoln Street connects the Wells Fargo Center to the building at 1700 Broadway which houses a food court, a small museum featuring artifacts, and memorabilia from Wells Fargo history, and the Downtown Denver branch of Wells Fargo Bank. Both buildings have large atriums constructed in the same cash register style.The building has its own unique zip code,

It is home to over 300 locally owned\/chain stores, over 50 restaurants, and the Denver Pavilions.HistoryThe 16th Street Mall opened in 1982, originally from Market Street to Broadway, and was designed by Pei Cobb Freed & Partners, with Henry N. Cobb as design partner, in collaboration with the urban design and landscape architecture firm, OLIN.The mall was extended from Market Street to Wynkoop Street in 2001 and to Union Station in 2002 to coincide with the completion of the Central Platte Valley (CPV) light rail spur. Before 1982, 16th Street was still a shopping and business destination that was home to four major department stores and many office buildings.Currently, the 16th Street Mall serves as a nexus for the major businesses downtown as well as the various tourist attractions that are nearby.Street performingTraditionally, street performing has been very popular on the mall, with many local folk, country, and vocal musicians gaining recognition in pop culture. Other types of performers, such as dancers, actors, impressionists, and comedians have also used the popular location as a prime venue for discovery.","id":"142847009060295","picture":{"data":{"is_silhouette":false,"url":"https:\/\/fbexternal-a.akamaihd.net\/safe_image.php?d=AQDw96aQI5WlD8Pw&w=50&h=50&url=http\u00253A\u00252F\u00252Fupload.wikimedia.org\u00252Fwikipedia\u00252Fcommons\u00252Fthumb\u00252Fd\u00252Fd3\u00252F2006-04-23_-_16th_Street_Mall_from_D\u00252526F_Tower.jpg\u00252F720px-2006-04-23_-_16th_Street_Mall_from_D\u00252526F_Tower.jpg&crop&fallback=hub_likes&prefix=q"}}},{"location":{"street":"","city":"Denver","state":"CO","country":"United States","zip":"80202","latitude":39.7391629732,"longitude":-104.990288252},"name":"City & County Of Denver - Holiday Lights","talking_about_count":0,"were_here_count":34,"id":"225265610879172","picture":{"data":{"is_silhouette":true,"url":"https:\/\/fbcdn-profile-a.akamaihd.net\/static-ak\/rsrc.php\/v2\/y5\/r\/j258ei8TIHu.png"}}},{"location":{"street":"","city":"Denver","state":"CO","country":"United States","zip":"","latitude":39.7417206,"longitude":-104.9937222},"name":"Colfax Marathon Expo","likes":1,"talking_about_count":0,"were_here_count":32,"id":"227154743966509","picture":{"data":{"is_silhouette":true,"url":"https:\/\/fbcdn-profile-a.akamaihd.net\/static-ak\/rsrc.php\/v2\/y5\/r\/j258ei8TIHu.png"}}},{"location":{"street":"","city":"Denver","state":"CO","country":"United States","zip":"","latitude":39.74008881,"longitude":-104.98252286},"name":"Cinnzzettis","likes":1,"talking_about_count":0,"were_here_count":15,"id":"243245249179994","picture":{"data":{"is_silhouette":true,"url":"https:\/\/fbcdn-profile-a.akamaihd.net\/static-ak\/rsrc.php\/v2\/yW\/r\/U2hFrus9i5v.png"}}},{"location":{"street":"201 W Colfax, Dept 601","city":"Denver","state":"CO","country":"United States","zip":"80202","latitude":39.740075066079,"longitude":-104.99053460054},"name":"Denver Parks and Recreation","likes":6128,"talking_about_count":74,"were_here_count":129,"price_range":"$ (0-10)","parking":{"street":1,"lot":1,"valet":0},"cover":{"cover_id":"10152861558723129","source":"https:\/\/scontent.xx.fbcdn.net\/hphotos-xfa1\/t31.0-8\/q85\/s720x720\/11155062_10152861558723129_3406813878345666407_o.jpg","offset_y":18,"offset_x":0},"website":"http:\/\/www.denvergov.org\/parksandrec","id":"114207528128","picture":{"data":{"is_silhouette":false,"url":"https:\/\/fbcdn-profile-a.akamaihd.net\/hprofile-ak-ash2\/v\/t1.0-1\/p50x50\/1460054_10151834413288129_1248127681_n.jpg?oh=ca8f6912f659e0137d16913c632fd854&oe=56468852&__gda__=1446652472_6ae5185aacfcf88b22caf117173f38f7"}}},{"location":{"street":"","city":"Denver","state":"CO","country":"United States","zip":"","latitude":39.744514189698,"longitude":-104.98536262671},"name":"North in Cherry Creek","likes":2,"talking_about_count":0,"were_here_count":25,"id":"275071885836996","picture":{"data":{"is_silhouette":true,"url":"https:\/\/fbcdn-profile-a.akamaihd.net\/static-ak\/rsrc.php\/v2\/y5\/r\/j258ei8TIHu.png"}}},{"location":{"street":"650 15th St","city":"Denver","state":"CO","country":"United States","zip":"80202","latitude":39.743877950961,"longitude":-104.99416888346},"name":"Peaks Lounge Hyatt Regency","likes":12,"talking_about_count":8,"were_here_count":767,"id":"337202086327910","picture":{"data":{"is_silhouette":true,"url":"https:\/\/fbcdn-profile-a.akamaihd.net\/static-ak\/rsrc.php\/v2\/y5\/r\/j258ei8TIHu.png"}}},{"location":{"street":"406 E Colfax Ave Denver, CO 80203","city":"Denver","state":"CO","country":"United States","zip":"80203","latitude":39.73983,"longitude":-104.9820023},"name":"Snow Thai Cafe","talking_about_count":0,"were_here_count":40,"id":"474786145944359","picture":{"data":{"is_silhouette":true,"url":"https:\/\/fbcdn-profile-a.akamaihd.net\/static-ak\/rsrc.php\/v2\/y5\/r\/j258ei8TIHu.png"}}},{"location":{"street":"","city":"Denver","state":"CO","country":"United States","zip":"","latitude":39.74411104,"longitude":-104.9940808},"name":"Coyote Ulgys Denver","talking_about_count":0,"were_here_count":22,"id":"481415875218332","picture":{"data":{"is_silhouette":true,"url":"https:\/\/fbcdn-profile-a.akamaihd.net\/static-ak\/rsrc.php\/v2\/y5\/r\/j258ei8TIHu.png"}}},{"location":{"street":"1400 Stout St","city":"Denver","state":"CO","country":"United States","zip":"80202","latitude":39.744326993183,"longitude":-104.99538691655},"name":"Stout Street Social","likes":882,"talking_about_count":133,"were_here_count":3157,"description":"Stout Street Social works hard to bring you delicious food, for friends, for fun, for sharing, and for being social.

These five words are the foundation of Thyme Table. As a chef and lover of food and wine I believe that without these factors we find our selves with merely good food. Each potential menu item changes seasonally to insure we make the most of current harvests and freshest produce, herbs and spices. Every season boasts its own spectacular flavor profiles and provide optimum flavors and freshness when cooking within these natural guidelines. This achieves and reflects characteristics specific to Colorado and portray the natural beauty of this state. Seasonal, organic, local and flavor are inherently associated with exceptional cuisine however Community plays an essential part. The table and the food on it brings people together in an unpretentious, celebratory and..... manner. Not only does food bring together friends, strangers and loved ones, I firmly believe that community takes delicious food to the next level. It amplifies simple and fresh ingredients done well through the mere aspect of congregation of people. I have found that people are most happy when eating and spending time with the people they love. The combination brings about a memorable occasion.  Thyme Table has the specific goal of creating this communal, food driven experience specific to each occasion.
