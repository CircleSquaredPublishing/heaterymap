EDL, known for its boutique hospitality venues, opens Toca Madera in the heart of West Hollywood pairing modern organic Mexican cuisine with fresh seasonal cocktails. \n\nToca Madera, which translates to \u201cknock on wood,\u201d is an intimate 120-seat space that features a creative take on traditional Mexican cuisine designed by Executive Chef Raymond Alvarez. Chef Raymond refers to his culinary approach as \u201cBarrio Style Fine Dining,\u201d influenced by traditional Latin flavors, classical training and his favorite child-hood dishes.  Providing an array of options for every eater, Toca Madera\u2019s menu incor-porates a shared-plate format offering locally farm-sourced ingredients with an emphasis on organic, as well as vegan and gluten-free options.  Dishes offered include: Tableside Guacamole, Wagyu Hot Stone, Sashimi Agua Chile, Ensenada-Style Fish Tacos, Barrio Crudit\u00e9s and Mixed Mushroom & Sweet Corn Tacos, among other dishes.  Farm fresh and seasonal ingredients also serve as the foundation for the extensive cocktail list. Featuring a 100 ft. crystal-quartz island bar, Toca Madera offers the finest tequilas and mezcals, as well as a rotating selection of the world\u2019s most interesting wines. \n\n\u201cToca Madera is a personal evolution in hospitality for Amrou and me,\u201d says co-creator Tosh Berman. \u201cStemming from a passion for service & design along with our extensive history in nightlife, this venue is a representation of our maturity within an industry that we have made our life's work.\u201d \nFully-equipped with a world-class sound system, the 4,500 sq. ft. restaurant and lounge includes a retractable roof and interior patio, creating an open-air dining environment. Architectural features include Arabesque accents, handcrafted custom woodwork and numerous fire elements, all contributing to the alluring and unique aesthetic. With its modern organic cuisine and farm fresh seasonal cocktails, Toca Madera makes for a sexy departure from the traditional Mexican restaurant experience.\n\n \u201cToca Madera was conceived around a communal dining philosophy, and the menu was designed to have choices everyone can agree on, drinker or non-drinker, vegan or paleo,\u201d says co-creator Amrou Manaseer. \u201cThere\u2019s something primitive about sharing a meal with friends, old and new, under the stars and by the light of a fire \u2013 it\u2019s something that we lost a long time ago but don\u2019t realize how much we miss.\u201d\n\nToca Madera is an ideal destination for a sensory-engaging escape from the everyday, and delivers a distinctive, memorable experience from the moment you walk through the door. \n","hours":{"mon_1_open":"17:00","mon_1_close":"02:00","sat_1_open":"17:00","sat_1_close":"02:00","sun_1_open":"11:00","sun_1_close":"02:00"},"price_range":"$$$ (30-50)","parking":{"street":1,"lot":0,"valet":1},"cover":{"cover_id":"776965439081042","source":"https:\/\/scontent.xx.fbcdn.net\/hphotos-xpf1\/v\/t1.0-9\/q83\/s720x720\/11825725_776965439081042_7486554463643872581_n.jpg?oh=9de7992ab318c9e0b14ed1d893967e11&oe=563D8F15","offset_y":0,"offset_x":0},"restaurant_services":{"reserve":1,"walkins":0,"groups":1,"kids":0,"takeout":1,"delivery":0,"catering":1,"waiter":1,"outdoor":0},"restaurant_specialties":{"breakfast":0,"lunch":0,"dinner":1,"coffee":0,"drinks":1},"website":"http:\/\/www.tocamadera.com","id":"584264498351138","picture":{"data":{"is_silhouette":false,"url":"https:\/\/fbcdn-profile-a.akamaihd.net\/hprofile-ak-xaf1\/v\/t1.0-1\/p50x50\/10570465_584265521684369_754784075363024012_n.jpg?oh=8d3c0b4e7dd5074522a47a8b874fced9&oe=563AF932&__gda__=1448202872_8b3ce1761a03b39296a117475e752e9f"}}},{"location":{"street":"747 N La Cienega Blvd","city":"West Hollywood","state":"CA","country":"United States","zip":"90069","latitude":34.084989463312,"longitude":-118.37661289798},"name":"The Belmont Los Angeles","likes":4134,"talking_about_count":590,"were_here_count":20361,"general_manager":"Ray Garcia","hours":{"mon_1_open":"11:30","mon_1_close":"02:00","tue_1_open":"11:30","tue_1_close":"02:00","wed_1_open":"11:30","wed_1_close":"02:00","thu_1_open":"11:30","thu_1_close":"02:00","fri_1_open":"11:30","fri_1_close":"02:00","sat_1_open":"10:00","sat_1_close":"02:00","sun_1_open":"10:00","sun_1_close":"02:00"},"price_range":"$$ (10-30)","parking":{"street":1,"lot":0,"valet":1},"cover":{"cover_id":"10151806843336259","source":"https:\/\/scontent.xx.fbcdn.net\/hphotos-frc3\/v\/t1.0-9\/s720x720\/578419_10151806843336259_2057664478_n.jpg?oh=bc19c379697a1ade18e5f11d695b4ffb&oe=563D261B","offset_y":24,"offset_x":0},"restaurant_services":{"reserve":1,"walkins":1,"groups":1,"kids":0,"takeout":1,"delivery":0,"catering":0,"waiter":1,"outdoor":1},"restaurant_specialties":{"breakfast":1,"lunch":1,"dinner":1,"coffee":0,"drinks":1},"website":"http:\/\/belmontla.com\/","id":"291724976258","picture":{"data":{"is_silhouette":false,"url":"https:\/\/fbcdn-profile-a.akamaihd.net\/hprofile-ak-xpf1\/v\/t1.0-1\/p50x50\/1390466_10152030833836259_1990629127_n.png?oh=ef2c78a0743fffef3d2419ff74149286&oe=5641D5D6&__gda__=1451512316_76f971f83830906c9cafc82ff570b871"}}},{"location":{"street":"Http:\/\/Wwwhugosrestaurantcom\/Locations","city":"Los Angeles","state":"CA","country":"United States","zip":"","latitude":34.090805607577,"longitude":-118.37288572756},"name":"Hugo's","likes":4283,"talking_about_count":62,"were_here_count":0,"description":"Real food made in real ways.

I then was brought to Los Angeles by my parents and have lived here ever since. I have to thank my mother Roberta and both of my grandmothers Cesarina and Ida for giving me a gift that few people have received, which is allowing me to watch and participate while they cooked for our family and friends. Sundays were extremely important days when it came to cooking. It was when my mother would start preparing food the day before. Everyday, my mother and I would go to the open market just down the street to shop for the lunch and dinner she would prepare. When it was warm enough, we would take our bikes and on the way, we would pass the tiny panificio on the corner of Via Piave where you could smell the baking flour and yeast long before getting there. We would always stop and buy bread\u2014 and if I was extremely lucky, I would get a small piece of focaccia to eat right there. At the open market, we would be able to buy the fruits and vegetables that were in season only. However, because our town was right on the coast, there was always an abundant amount of fish to pick from. My mother, being originally from Piacenza in Emilia Romagna, used her love of homemade paste and ravioli and incorporated them together with traditional Tuscan recipes to always create memorable meals.\n\nIt is precisely this that I have worked to recreate at e. baldi. Nothing fancy, no dishes with too many ingredients and flavors. I make the dishes that were part of my life, that remind me of precious times that I now miss greatly. I do this from the appetizers all the way to the desserts. This is why I went to study under the legendary baker and pastry chef in Tuscany, Angelo Baldini. He taught me the history behind Tuscan desserts and how to make them. To many food critics here, these Italian desserts are meaningless, while to all Italians they are essential and sacred. I hope you join me to experience what I believe to be the most satisfying food to eat. True, simple Tuscan food with an accent of Emilia Romagna that I love to make for my customers.","price_range":"$$$ (30-50)","parking":{"street":1,"lot":1,"valet":1},"cover":{"cover_id":"884643628237621","source":"https:\/\/scontent.xx.fbcdn.net\/hphotos-xpf1\/t31.0-8\/p480x480\/11728779_884643628237621_154056687673913629_o.jpg","offset_y":48,"offset_x":0},"restaurant_services":{"reserve":1,"walkins":1,"groups":1,"kids":1,"takeout":1,"delivery":0,"catering":0,"waiter":1,"outdoor":1},"restaurant_specialties":{"breakfast":0,"lunch":1,"dinner":1,"coffee":1,"drinks":1},"website":"www.ebaldi.com","id":"250033748365282","picture":{"data":{"is_silhouette":false,"url":"https:\/\/fbcdn-profile-a.akamaihd.net\/hprofile-ak-xft1\/v\/t1.0-1\/p50x50\/11693890_880613198640664_715018223952478590_n.jpg?oh=9edb30b583b1e19011529237b93f6831&oe=56428F46&__gda__=1448460186_d0d1a5487198b226fe8bcfa79a6b2f9c"}}},{"location":{"street":"453 N Canon Dr","city":"Beverly Hills","state":"CA","country":"United States","zip":"90210","latitude":34.0713806,"longitude":-118.4018173},"name":"Nic's Beverly Hills","likes":175,"talking_about_count":9,"were_here_count":546,"hours":{"mon_1_open":"16:00","mon_1_close":"12:00","tue_1_open":"16:00","tue_1_close":"12:00","wed_1_open":"16:00","wed_1_close":"12:00","thu_1_open":"16:00","thu_1_close":"02:00","fri_1_open":"16:00","fri_1_close":"02:00","sat_1_open":"16:00","sat_1_close":"02:00","sun_1_open":"16:00","sun_1_close":"02:00"},"cover":{"cover_id":"1408458415854639","source":"https:\/\/scontent.xx.fbcdn.net\/hphotos-xta1\/t31.0-8\/s720x720\/11265561_1408458415854639_1237075163545426398_o.jpg","offset_y":47,"offset_x":0},"website":"http:\/\/www.nicsbeverlyhills.com\/","id":"651059384927883","picture":{"data":{"is_silhouette":false,"url":"https:\/\/fbcdn-profile-a.akamaihd.net\/hprofile-ak-xfa1\/v\/t1.0-1\/c6.0.50.50\/p50x50\/10898266_1154124714621345_8712592286240587642_n.jpg?oh=bb2ecaaaa1bb83c68975bb86ca6b0ae0&oe=5638D7BE&__gda__=1446933649_e7a5f8b91171db07fe2aa90057313918"}}},{"location":{"street":"9844 Wilshire Blvd","city":"Beverly Hills","state":"CA","country":"United States","zip":"902103115","latitude":34.0667114,"longitude":-118.4102707},"name":"Starbucks","likes":225,"talking_about_count":194,"were_here_count":3446,"hours":{"mon_1_open":"04:30","mon_1_close":"21:00","tue_1_open":"04:30","tue_1_close":"21:00","wed_1_open":"04:30","wed_1_close":"21:00","thu_1_open":"04:30","thu_1_close":"21:00","fri_1_open":"04:30","fri_1_close":"21:00","sat_1_open":"04:30","sat_1_close":"21:00","sun_1_open":"05:30","sun_1_close":"20:00"},"cover":{"cover_id":"10153473604558057","source":"https:\/\/scontent.xx.fbcdn.net\/hphotos-xtp1\/t31.0-8\/p480x480\/11794414_10153473604558057_6284310386114247336_o.jpg","offset_y":69,"offset_x":0},"website":"www.starbucks.com ","id":"134060523305539","picture":{"data":{"is_silhouette":false,"url":"https:\/\/fbcdn-profile-a.akamaihd.net\/hprofile-ak-xtp1\/v\/t1.0-1\/c1.0.50.50\/p50x50\/960181_10151919982378057_997575693_n.jpg?oh=43226f512bc05fcbda7074a0b6db5191&oe=564B07EA&__gda__=1448410091_e6be3feb7f2b10429020ac1c94f71564"}}},{"location":{"street":"","city":"Beverly Hills","state":"CA","country":"United States","zip":"90210","latitude":34.068731385789,"longitude":-118.39889014211},"name":"The Penthouse at Mastros Steakhouse Beverly Hills","likes":7,"talking_about_count":37,"were_here_count":94,"id":"1622417571378417","picture":{"data":{"is_silhouette":true,"url":"https:\/\/fbcdn-profile-a.akamaihd.net\/static-ak\/rsrc.php\/v2\/yW\/r\/U2hFrus9i5v.png"}}},{"location":{"street":"410 N Canon Dr","city":"Beverly Hills","state":"CA","country":"United States","zip":"90210","latitude":34.0710983,"longitude":-118.4008713},"name":"SHIKI Beverly Hills","likes":315,"talking_about_count":39,"were_here_count":481,"description":"\u201cShiki\u201d is a Japanese word meaning \u201cfour seasons.\u201d Traditional Japanese cuisine, known as \u201cWashoku,\u201d respects the natural beauty of the changing seasons by highlighting seasonable wild ingredients.

Originally a Spanish ranch where lima beans were grown, it was incorporated in 1914 by a group of investors who had failed to find oil, but found water instead and eventually decided to develop it into a town. By 2013, its population had grown to 34,658. Sometimes referred to as \"90210\", one of its primary ZIP codes, it is home to many actors and celebrities. The city includes the Rodeo Drive shopping district and the Beverly Hills Oil Field.HistoryEarly historyGaspar de Portol\u00e0 arrived in the area that would become Beverly Hills on August 3, 1769, travelling along native trails which followed the present-day route of Wilshire Boulevard. The area was settled by Maria Rita Quinteros de Valdez and her husband in 1828. They called their 4500acre of property the Rancho Rodeo de las Aguas. However, she was constantly harassed by Native Americans and seriously assaulted in 1852. Two years later, in 1854, she sold the ranch to Benjamin Davis Wilson (1811\u20131878) and Henry Hancock (1822\u20131883). By the 1880s, the ranch had been subdivided into parcels of 75acre and was being rapidly bought up by anglos from Los Angeles and the East coast.","id":"112456468765632","picture":{"data":{"is_silhouette":false,"url":"https:\/\/fbexternal-a.akamaihd.net\/safe_image.php?d=AQAua_3nlI-oWl6q&w=50&h=50&url=http\u00253A\u00252F\u00252Fupload.wikimedia.org\u00252Fwikipedia\u00252Fcommons\u00252Fthumb\u00252F4\u00252F47\u00252FRodeo_Drive_\u00252526_Via_Rodeo\u0025252C_Beverly_Hills\u0025252C_LA\u0025252C_CA\u0025252C_jjron_21.03.2012.jpg\u00252F720px-Rodeo_Drive_\u00252526_Via_Rodeo\u0025252C_Beverly_Hills\u0025252C_LA\u0025252C_CA\u0025252C_jjron_21.03.2012.jpg&crop&fallback=hub_city&prefix=q"}}},{"location":{"street":"433 N Bedford Dr","city":"Beverly Hills","state":"CA","country":"United States","zip":"90210","latitude":34.0683937,"longitude":-118.4057312},"name":"Judi's Deli","likes":74,"talking_about_count":9,"were_here_count":725,"description":"Our wonderful customers rave about our Matza Ball Soup, Tuna, Hot Pastrami, Avocado & Swiss Sandwiches, and our scrumptious wraps like the Turkey Avocado, Chicken Ceasar, or Falafel!

Drive","likes":8106,"talking_about_count":2719,"were_here_count":71533,"description":"Rodeo Drive is a two-mile long street, primarily in Beverly Hills, California. Its northern terminus is its intersection with Sunset Boulevard and its southern is its intersection with Beverwil Drive in the city of Los Angeles. The name is most commonly used metonymically to refer to a three block stretch of the street north of Wilshire Boulevard and south of Little Santa Monica Boulevard, which is known for its luxury-goods stores. The larger business district surrounding Rodeo, known as the \"Golden Triangle,\" which extends from Wilshire Boulevard to Santa Monica Boulevard, is both a shopping district and a major tourist attraction.HistoryEarly historyIn 1906, Burton E. Green (1868-1965) and other investors purchased the property that would become Beverly Hills, formerly named Rancho Rodeo de las Aguas, with plans for a mixed-use subdivision with a branch of the Los Angeles and Pacific Railway running North on Rodeo Drive before turning west at Sunset Boulevard. They platted the street that very year, in 1906. By 1907, 75x160 foot parcels on Rodeo were selling for $1,100 each. It became a bridle path in 1912, when the Beverly Hills Hotel was built on a former lima bean field. By November 1925, similar lots were selling for between $15,000 and $30,000, almost double what they'd been selling for in September.","id":"109512155735235","picture":{"data":{"is_silhouette":false,"url":"https:\/\/fbexternal-a.akamaihd.net\/safe_image.php?d=AQCs9r6CA0r12PUu&w=50&h=50&url=http\u00253A\u00252F\u00252Fupload.wikimedia.org\u00252Fwikipedia\u00252Fcommons\u00252Fthumb\u00252F1\u00252F12\u00252FRodeo_Drive\u0025252C_Beverly_Hills\u0025252C_LA\u0025252C_CA\u0025252C_jjron_21.03.2012.jpg\u00252F720px-Rodeo_Drive\u0025252C_Beverly_Hills\u0025252C_LA\u0025252C_CA\u0025252C_jjron_21.03.2012.jpg&crop&fallback=hub_likes&prefix=q"}}},{"location":{"street":"153 S Beverly Dr","city":"Beverly Hills","state":"CA","country":"United States","zip":"90212","latitude":34.06633260663,"longitude":-118.39859353389},"name":"Pickelz","likes":360,"talking_about_count":1,"were_here_count":17,"description":"Pickelz features an All-American menu with a unique twist and a touch of gourmet!

From his affable demeanor to his inventive and delicious takes on Italian fare, Chef Celestino Drago has helped lay the groundwork for Italian cuisine in America today. \n\nBefore launching his restaurant empire in Southern California, Celestino attended mechanical school in Italy while simultaneously working at a restaurant in the city of Pisa called Pierino. It was there that realized he \"loved everything about the restaurant business.\" Recognizing his culinary potential, the chef at Pierino worked closely with him and, in just three short years, Celestino took over as chef. \n\nCelestino's cuisine is deeply rooted in his childhood home in Sicily and since his arrival in Los Angeles; he has been delighting diners with dishes that hearken back to his home country?

This ancient volcanic site has left a legacy of fertile rich volcanic soil. No irrigation is necessary as the area has an average annual rainfall of 2000mm. The cooler sub-tropical climate slows the ripening of coffee and inhibits fungal growths. No pesticides are used on the property.\n\nByron Bay Blue has its roasting facility located within NSW, Australia a few hours south of the coffee farm. Our roasting releases oil and creates the flavor and aroma not evident in a green bean. The variations of time and temperature provides a large difference in the flavor of the same coffee bean, and it is only through trial and error that the roasters are able to find the most favorable combination \u2013 the results of which are highly guarded secrets once successful.\n\nOur roaster uses thermal Induction and our roasting drum is made from Stainless Steel, this helps in maintaining a constant roasting temperature throughout, and provides greater consistency on the roasting process. \n","cover":{"cover_id":"617331455078405","source":"https:\/\/scontent.xx.fbcdn.net\/hphotos-xtf1\/v\/t1.0-9\/s720x720\/11043233_617331455078405_5647994880995517020_n.png?oh=eee7cfe5319856cedb5a563574799185&oe=564B800C","offset_y":0,"offset_x":0},"website":"http:\/\/www.byronbayblue.net","id":"533834530094765","picture":{"data":{"is_silhouette":false,"url":"https:\/\/fbcdn-profile-a.akamaihd.net\/hprofile-ak-xat1\/v\/t1.0-1\/p50x50\/10407601_566463430165208_7994615646905274028_n.jpg?oh=b227f7c7507c71e4eb04de5c1291020b&oe=5645430F&__gda__=1447573835_0f351a9b60101a1c6fea28212336053e"}}},{"location":{"street":"421 N Rodeo Dr","city":"Beverly Hills","state":"CA","country":"United States","zip":"90210","latitude":34.069492,"longitude":-118.403738},"name":"A Cow Jumped Over The Moon","likes":156,"talking_about_count":2,"were_here_count":34,"general_manager":"Laurent Masliah","hours":{"mon_1_open":"11:30","mon_1_close":"15:00","tue_1_open":"11:30","tue_1_close":"15:00","wed_1_open":"11:30","wed_1_close":"15:00","thu_1_open":"11:30","thu_1_close":"15:00","fri_1_open":"11:30","fri_1_close":"15:00","sat_1_open":"20:00","sat_1_close":"23:30","sun_1_open":"11:30","sun_1_close":"22:00","mon_2_open":"17:30","mon_2_close":"22:00","tue_2_open":"17:30","tue_2_close":"22:00","wed_2_open":"17:30","wed_2_close":"22:00","thu_2_open":"17:30","thu_2_close":"22:00"},"price_range":"$$ (10-30)","parking":{"street":1,"lot":1,"valet":1},"restaurant_services":{"reserve":1,"walkins":1,"groups":1,"kids":1,"takeout":1,"delivery":1,"catering":1,"waiter":1,"outdoor":1},"restaurant_specialties":{"breakfast":0,"lunch":1,"dinner":1,"coffee":1,"drinks":1},"website":"www.acowonrodeo.com","id":"63522646711","picture":{"data":{"is_silhouette":false,"url":"https:\/\/fbcdn-profile-a.akamaihd.net\/hprofile-ak-xpf1\/t5.0-1\/50316_63522646711_2974571_q.jpg"}}},{"location":{"street":"","city":"Beverly Hills","state":"CA","country":"United States","zip":"90210","latitude":34.070578814394,"longitude":-118.40258799582},"name":"Beverly Drive, LA","talking_about_count":1,"were_here_count":81,"id":"139259902857457","picture":{"data":{"is_silhouette":true,"url":"https:\/\/fbcdn-profile-a.akamaihd.net\/static-ak\/rsrc.php\/v2\/y5\/r\/j258ei8TIHu.png"}}},{"location":{"street":"9465 Wilshire Blvd","city":"Beverly Hills","state":"CA","country":"United States","zip":"90212","latitude":34.067465712778,"longitude":-118.3998471946},"name":"Principato-Young Entertainment","likes":81,"talking_about_count":2,"were_here_count":55,"id":"199597900062880","picture":{"data":{"is_silhouette":true,"url":"https:\/\/fbcdn-profile-a.akamaihd.net\/static-ak\/rsrc.php\/v2\/y5\/r\/j258ei8TIHu.png"}}},{"location":{"street":"BULLDOG REALTORS","city":"Beverly Hills","state":"CA","country":"United States","zip":"90291","latitude":34.0734711,"longitude":-118.4077682},"name":"Judi Nasta - Realtor","likes":59,"talking_about_count":0,"were_here_count":0,"cover":{"cover_id":"1094757577220625","source":"https:\/\/scontent.xx.fbcdn.net\/hphotos-xap1\/v\/t1.0-9\/p180x540\/10405696_1094757577220625_8379811412480056604_n.jpg?oh=3af573ce5f460555f28e13347acb47f3&oe=56395021","offset_y":50,"offset_x":0},"id":"905847132778338","picture":{"data":{"is_silhouette":false,"url":"https:\/\/fbcdn-profile-a.akamaihd.net\/hprofile-ak-xtp1\/v\/t1.0-1\/p50x50\/11536041_1094755753887474_3383295062134476163_n.jpg?oh=1b49b715efb2dbc9af205bcec155ded6&oe=5647B99A&__gda__=1447732891_79dbbecf20f64385afb457f830afd096"}}},{"location":{"street":"233 N.

Amy Heckerling, 1995), and in The Go-Go's music video for Our Lips Are Sealed.In 2014-2015, Chinese businessman Wang Jianlin donated US$200,000 for the restoration of the fountain.","id":"143467195671075","picture":{"data":{"is_silhouette":false,"url":"https:\/\/fbexternal-a.akamaihd.net\/safe_image.php?d=AQBSfUqxmIq5mds6&w=50&h=50&url=http\u00253A\u00252F\u00252Fupload.wikimedia.org\u00252Fwikipedia\u00252Fcommons\u00252Fthumb\u00252F6\u00252F61\u00252FElectric_Fountain_in_Beverly_Hills\u0025252C_California.JPG\u00252F720px-Electric_Fountain_in_Beverly_Hills\u0025252C_California.JPG&crop&fallback=hub_likes&prefix=q"}}},{"location":{"street":"Sunset Plaza, 8595 Sunset Blvd","city":"West Hollywood","state":"CA","country":"United States","zip":"90069","latitude":34.0926628,"longitude":-118.3792877},"name":"Drybar WeHo","likes":172,"talking_about_count":14,"were_here_count":3823,"hours":{"mon_1_open":"08:00","mon_1_close":"19:00","tue_1_open":"08:00","tue_1_close":"19:00","wed_1_open":"08:00","wed_1_close":"19:00","thu_1_open":"08:00","thu_1_close":"21:00","fri_1_open":"08:00","fri_1_close":"21:00","sat_1_open":"08:00","sat_1_close":"21:00","sun_1_open":"10:00","sun_1_close":"19:00"},"parking":{"street":0,"lot":1,"valet":0},"website":"www.thedrybar.com","id":"168526719826545","picture":{"data":{"is_silhouette":true,"url":"https:\/\/fbcdn-profile-a.akamaihd.net\/static-ak\/rsrc.php\/v2\/y5\/r\/j258ei8TIHu.png"}}},{"location":{"street":"","city":"Beverly Hills","state":"CA","country":"United States","zip":"","latitude":34.068800197015,"longitude":-118.40412718255},"name":"Camden drive in Beverly Hills","likes":1,"talking_about_count":0,"were_here_count":26,"id":"150978094927271","picture":{"data":{"is_silhouette":true,"url":"https:\/\/fbcdn-profile-a.akamaihd.net\/static-ak\/rsrc.php\/v2\/yW\/r\/U2hFrus9i5v.png"}}},{"location":{"street":"454 N Canon Dr","city":"Beverly Hills","state":"CA","country":"United States","zip":"90210","latitude":34.071560766018,"longitude":-118.40179904054},"name":"Il Tramezzino","likes":1401,"talking_about_count":21,"were_here_count":6221,"description":"The Original Italian Cafe","price_range":"$$ (10-30)","parking":{"street":1,"lot":1,"valet":1},"cover":{"cover_id":"713618718657884","source":"https:\/\/scontent.xx.fbcdn.net\/hphotos-xaf1\/t31.0-8\/s720x720\/1601677_713618718657884_461853564_o.jpg","offset_y":41,"offset_x":0},"restaurant_services":{"reserve":1,"walkins":1,"groups":1,"kids":1,"takeout":1,"delivery":1,"catering":1,"waiter":1,"outdoor":1},"restaurant_specialties":{"breakfast":1,"lunch":1,"dinner":1,"coffee":1,"drinks":1},"website":"http:\/\/www.iltramezzino.com","id":"112469802106115","picture":{"data":{"is_silhouette":false,"url":"https:\/\/fbcdn-profile-a.akamaihd.net\/hprofile-ak-xpt1\/v\/t1.0-1\/p50x50\/1970411_761702673849488_1024633470_n.png?oh=4e51d4ee2bbbc12139f6a4f2d7531534&oe=564F5C89&__gda__=1446591238_d8b7bd14495780c25c49415acbf009ed"}}},{"location":{"street":"8592 Santa Monica Blvd","city":"West Hollywood","state":"CA","country":"United States","zip":"90069","latitude":34.08807537211,"longitude":-118.37903156784},"name":"LASC","likes":2399,"talking_about_count":4,"were_here_count":0,"description":"Founded in 1983, LASC is considered by many to be the largest mens clothing store in the city of Los Angeles and is a West Hollywood landmark.

In 1962 while filming in Rome, for example, Liz Taylor had several orders of Chasen\u2019s chili flown to the set of Cleopatra.\nMany of the restaurant's regular customers had booths named in their honor. The Ronald Reagan booth, now on display at the Ronald Reagan Presidential Library, was where Reagan proposed to Nancy Reagan. Other well-known entertainers with their own booths included Frank Sinatra, Alfred Hitchcock, James Stewart, and Groucho Marx. After suffering a steep decline in business over the course of many years, Chasen's closed permanently in 1995.","website":"http:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/index.html?curid=4620115","id":"865836730122333","picture":{"data":{"is_silhouette":true,"url":"https:\/\/fbcdn-profile-a.akamaihd.net\/static-ak\/rsrc.php\/v2\/yW\/r\/U2hFrus9i5v.png"}}},{"location":{"street":"9360 Wilshire Blvd.","city":"Beverly Hills","state":"CA","country":"United States","zip":"90212","latitude":34.066934,"longitude":-118.396233},"name":"Caulfield's Bar and Dining Room","talking_about_count":0,"were_here_count":0,"id":"437162083130411","picture":{"data":{"is_silhouette":true,"url":"https:\/\/fbcdn-profile-a.akamaihd.net\/static-ak\/rsrc.php\/v2\/yW\/r\/U2hFrus9i5v.png"}}},{"location":{"street":"8350 West Third St","city":"Los Angeles","state":"CA","country":"United States","zip":"90048","latitude":34.0726089,"longitude":-118.3718796},"name":"Joan's on Third","likes":7988,"talking_about_count":215,"were_here_count":24255,"hours":{"mon_1_open":"08:00","mon_1_close":"20:00","tue_1_open":"08:00","tue_1_close":"20:00","wed_1_open":"08:00","wed_1_close":"20:00","thu_1_open":"08:00","thu_1_close":"20:00","fri_1_open":"08:00","fri_1_close":"20:00","sat_1_open":"08:00","sat_1_close":"20:00","sun_1_open":"08:00","sun_1_close":"19:00"},"price_range":"$$ (10-30)","parking":{"street":1,"lot":1,"valet":1},"cover":{"cover_id":"10151889763771733","source":"https:\/\/scontent.xx.fbcdn.net\/hphotos-xtp1\/v\/t1.0-9\/s720x720\/1521613_10151889763771733_1916741390_n.jpg?oh=ebc807066753f5e231d7b75b52687602&oe=564BC68B","offset_y":0,"offset_x":0},"restaurant_services":{"reserve":0,"walkins":1,"groups":1,"kids":1,"takeout":1,"delivery":1,"catering":1,"waiter":0,"outdoor":1},"restaurant_specialties":{"breakfast":1,"lunch":1,"dinner":1,"coffee":1,"drinks":0},"website":"www.joansonthird.com","id":"162854736732","picture":{"data":{"is_silhouette":false,"url":"https:\/\/fbcdn-profile-a.akamaihd.net\/hprofile-ak-xfa1\/v\/t1.0-1\/p50x50\/1607033_10151892240106733_1487958181_n.jpg?oh=7c4b8813a8502032ffe4d07458c60cfb&oe=56432AD3&__gda__=1447864680_e29db3a4056aefe71be039bf6ddfdc94"}}}],"paging":{"next":"https:\/\/graph.facebook.com\/v2.4\/search?fields=location,name,likes,talking_about_count,were_here_count,description,general_manager,hours,price_range,parking,picture,cover,restaurant_services,restaurant_specialties,website&limit=5000&type=place&q=restaurant&center=34.0736204,-118.4003563&distance=3200&access_token=1452021355091002|x-ZB0iKqWQmYqnJQ-wXoUjl-XtY&offset=5000&__after_id=enc_AdDRqZAZB4ZC1U9CtESZCBIoMHl8c1qhTxlEy2VlkiXGyMqzHKQYYCrhiY7riG1ZBbMr2VmwZD"}}
