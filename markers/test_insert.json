Gus Belt, Steak \u2018n Shake\u2019s founder, pioneered the concept of premium burgers and milk shakes. The Steak 'n Shake name has been symbolic of its heritage. The word \u201csteak\u201d stood for STEAKBURGER. The term \u201cshake\u201d stood for hand-dipped MILK SHAKES. Gus was determined to serve his customers the finest burgers and shakes in the business. To prove his point that his burgers were exceptionally prime, he would wheel in a barrel of steaks (including round, sirloin, and T-bones) and grind the meat into burgers right in front of the guests. Hence arose the origin of our famous slogan, \u201cIn Sight It Must Be Right.\u201d After 79 years, we are continuing Steak n Shake\u2019s tradition of serving the country\u2019s best, freshest, and tastiest burgers and shakes.","price_range":"$ (0-10)","parking":{"street":0,"lot":1,"valet":0},"cover":{"cover_id":"10153404092380041","source":"https:\/\/scontent.xx.fbcdn.net\/hphotos-xtp1\/v\/t1.0-9\/s720x720\/11846784_10153404092380041_3826015758679053130_n.jpg?oh=08abd598ea149ec6d77820876fbdd48b&oe=5650D206","offset_y":0,"offset_x":0},"website":"http:\/\/www.steaknshake.com\/locations\/23871-steak-n-shake-linton-blvd-delray-beach","id":"248443115304782","picture":{"data":{"is_silhouette":false,"url":"https:\/\/fbcdn-profile-a.akamaihd.net\/hprofile-ak-xfa1\/v\/t1.0-1\/p50x50\/577119_10151215591030041_1131737081_n.jpg?oh=3a9093a7ac4a3af848f42627868c458b&oe=56839162&__gda__=1451186941_024926e4ea14de49bf50eccb5102df5e"}}},{"location":{"street":"386 C SE 2nd Ave","city":"Delray Beach","state":"FL","country":"United States","zip":"33483","latitude":26.454977,"longitude":-80.0710831},"name":"Best Caribbean Food Restaurant","likes":185,"talking_about_count":0,"were_here_count":80,"hours":{"mon_1_open":"08:00","mon_1_close":"22:00","tue_1_open":"08:00","tue_1_close":"22:00","wed_1_open":"08:00","wed_1_close":"22:00","thu_1_open":"08:00","thu_1_close":"22:00","fri_1_open":"08:00","fri_1_close":"22:00","sat_1_open":"08:00","sat_1_close":"22:00","sun_1_open":"09:00","sun_1_close":"18:00"},"cover":{"cover_id":"1584594658435814","source":"https:\/\/scontent.xx.fbcdn.net\/hphotos-xpa1\/v\/t1.0-9\/p180x540\/250358_1584594658435814_639893710309927624_n.jpg?oh=ff8d369040186603281fc0c84077e069&oe=567F64F1","offset_y":48,"offset_x":0},"id":"1584593291769284","picture":{"data":{"is_silhouette":false,"url":"https:\/\/fbcdn-profile-a.akamaihd.net\/hprofile-ak-xfp1\/v\/t1.0-1\/c8.0.50.50\/p50x50\/16207_1584593608435919_3630114184171878641_n.jpg?oh=4295a5d3dd1ce8ad103f01f169442020&oe=56483F60&__gda__=1446895079_565751ad423fceb9bdf292504d3aad0a"}}},{"location":{"street":"139 NW 5th Ave","city":"Delray Beach","state":"FL","country":"United States","zip":"33444-2652","latitude":26.4649906,"longitude":-80.0779724},"name":"The Restaurant Inc","likes":1,"talking_about_count":0,"were_here_count":1,"id":"116456478379562","picture":{"data":{"is_silhouette":true,"url":"https:\/\/fbcdn-profile-a.akamaihd.net\/static-ak\/rsrc.php\/v2\/yW\/r\/U2hFrus9i5v.png"}}},{"location":{"street":"540 W Atlantic Ave","city":"Delray Beach","state":"FL","country":"United States","zip":"33444-2556","latitude":26.46138,"longitude":-80.07901},"name":"Jackie One Restaurants","talking_about_count":0,"were_here_count":3,"id":"113517005348358","picture":{"data":{"is_silhouette":true,"url":"https:\/\/fbcdn-profile-a.akamaihd.net\/static-ak\/rsrc.php\/v2\/yW\/r\/U2hFrus9i5v.png"}}},{"location":{"street":"1731 N Federal Hwy","city":"Delray Beach","state":"FL","country":"United States","zip":"33483","latitude":26.482181209126,"longitude":-80.065681671178},"name":"Eclectic Eats Restaurant Lounge & Garden","likes":1278,"talking_about_count":1,"were_here_count":281,"description":"\"We do international cuisine our own way\"\nBy Trying our Multiple Course meals, you will experience a unique miscellany of tastes and aromas that bring the world to your plate.

BBQ","likes":11209,"talking_about_count":167,"were_here_count":19838,"description":"Smoke BBQ (eatbbqnow.com), formerly known as Union, has just opened at 8 East Atlantic Avenue in Delray Beach. The new concept will feature authentic Kansas City style, smokehouse BBQ -- low and slow smoked meats, including burnt ends.  They will also feature Carolina pulled pork, affordable entr\u00e9e selections, a cool, casual \u2018American backyard\u2019 design, a large craft beer selection, exceptional Happy Hour promotions, and a Pitmaster whose BBQ credentials are world-renowned. \n\nSMOKE BBQ is owned by local restaurateurs, Stephen Chin and Scott Kennedy.Executive Chef and Pitmaster Bryan Tyrell is formerly of the famed Oklahoma Joe's in Kansas City, Mo. (Anthony Bourdain named it \u201cOne of the 13 places to eat before you die\u201d); and Bodean's BBQ in London. Tyrell is an original member of Kansas City\u2019s Slaughterhouse Five, and is a member of the two-time American Royal Grand Champion team in the World Series of BBQ.\n\n\u201cBryan Tyrell is not only the most experienced and successful competitive BBQ Pitmaster living in South Florida, but likely the entire state,\u201d said Kennedy. \u201cWe\u2019re thrilled he has brought his award-winning talents to Atlantic Avenue.\u201dSMOKE BBQ will feature 15-hour oak smoked beef brisket, spare ribs, chicken, turkey and pulled pork, smoked each day using dry rubs.  The restaurant will also offer Kansas City classic burnt ends on Wednesdays (while they last.)  Additionally, SMOKE BBQ will have fresh fish and vegetarian options.  Cocktails will be made with quality purees and house-made simple syrups\u2014all at affordable prices. \n\nBryan Tyrell began his love affair with barbeque when former college roommate, Jeff Stehney, introduced him to the world of competitive BBQ in the late 1980\u2019s.  In 1990, Bryan became a member of Slaughterhouse Five, a competitive BBQ team.  \n\nSlaughterhouse Five went on to be one of the most successful competitive BBQ teams in the U.S., winning the 1993 American Royal - Open Division and 1995 American Royal - Invitational Division--long considered the World Championship of BBQ.  \n\n\"For me, smoking meat is a passion and an art form. Good barbecue is a feeling; it's a touch, a feel, a taste, and understanding that has been earned from years of experience. My philosophy is, why do something if it's not going to be great?\u201d Tyrell said.\n\nSMOKE BBQ will be open 6 days a week (closing on Tuesdays). Happy Hour will continue in its former Union tradition, with the best deals on the Ave. Happy Hours are: Mondays, Wednesday, Thursday and Saturday hours 5-7 pm; Fridays 5-8 pm; and Sundays all day. On premises corporate BBQ events and catering are also available.  Delivery Dudes will be the preferred delivery option. \n \nSMOKE BBQ has the largest screen in a restaurant in Palm Beach County, and two additional oversized projections screens to watch college games on Saturdays and NFL games on Sundays.  The restaurant will feature live music several nights a week.  The kitchen will close at 10:00 p.m. for late night dancing.  Food will be available until 1:45 a.m. with a late night snack menu.\n \nFor more information, call 561-330-4236 or visit www.eatbbqnow.com.

The Porch is located in Delray\u2019s historic Blank House, built in 1907 and carefully restored, with beautiful, hardwood floors, a sunny-yellow exterior and an expansive wood deck just added to the garden area so that guests may enjoy dining indoors or out in the beautiful South Florida weather.\n\nCo-owners of two other restaurants, \u201cCafe Via Flora\u201d on Worth Avenue in Palm Beach, winner of 2012\u2032s \u201cBest New Business\u201d award by the Palm Beach Chamber of Commerce and open year-round, as well as \u201cRustico at The Log Cabin\u201d, open for summer season in Highlands, North Carolina, Pamela & Heinrich have over twenty years of experience in the restaurant and hospitality industry. In the last few years, they often found themselves driving out of the Palm Beach area, continuously searching for other inspiring and sophisticated dining areas in South Florida. Their affinity grew quickly for Delray\u2019s wide array of dining choices with enthusiastic owners and staff, impressive cuisine and bold interior design concepts. It wasn\u2019t long before the planning and excitement began at the idea of becoming a part of downtown Delray\u2019s robust culinary community.\n\nFor The Porch, located in this special, historic venue long-treasured by the town, Pamela and Heinrich wanted to bring their very best, patron-favorite recipes created & gathered over the years from around the world to the residents and visitors of Delray Beach.\n\nIn an elegant atmosphere, using the very best ingredients, the owners aim to keep a casual and comfortable feel for everyone. Whether stopping by for a glass of wine on the outdoor deck or joining us for dinner, we welcome you and hope you enjoy\u2026","hours":{"mon_1_open":"17:00","mon_1_close":"23:00","tue_1_open":"17:00","tue_1_close":"23:00","wed_1_open":"17:00","wed_1_close":"23:00","thu_1_open":"17:00","thu_1_close":"23:00","fri_1_open":"17:00","fri_1_close":"23:00","sat_1_open":"17:00","sat_1_close":"23:00","sun_1_open":"17:00","sun_1_close":"23:00"},"cover":{"cover_id":"435827253215320","source":"https:\/\/scontent.xx.fbcdn.net\/hphotos-xfp1\/v\/t1.0-9\/s720x720\/1897904_435827253215320_2046970680_n.png?oh=b78059c5d0bef269267a1e247048ac5f&oe=56454A69","offset_y":50,"offset_x":0},"website":"http:\/\/theporchdelraybeach.com","id":"412094415588604","picture":{"data":{"is_silhouette":false,"url":"https:\/\/fbcdn-profile-a.akamaihd.net\/hprofile-ak-xap1\/v\/t1.0-1\/p50x50\/1536443_412149198916459_1298523810_n.png?oh=33fd8aeede2b9f363886ce04a1d3eb6f&oe=5646963F&__gda__=1446805121_289c9732abcf903a89a6d8cd31c97a44"}}},{"location":{"street":"220 Congress Park Dr","city":"Delray Beach","state":"FL","country":"United States","zip":"33445-4670","latitude":26.4568996,"longitude":-80.0943909},"name":"Bri 1805 Congress LLC","talking_about_count":0,"were_here_count":112,"id":"161544597202499","picture":{"data":{"is_silhouette":true,"url":"https:\/\/fbcdn-profile-a.akamaihd.net\/static-ak\/rsrc.php\/v2\/y5\/r\/j258ei8TIHu.png"}}},{"location":{"street":"302 NE 4th St","city":"Delray Beach","state":"FL","country":"United States","zip":"33444","latitude":26.46875,"longitude":-80.0696106},"name":"Fit Food Express","likes":1609,"talking_about_count":8,"were_here_count":311,"description":"Gourmet food...without the weight!
