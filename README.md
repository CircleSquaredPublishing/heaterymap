#Visual Data Representations
###Using the Google Maps and Facebook APIs
####Development build for heatery program.
#####Version 0.0.1
#####August 7, 2015

This program gathers public restaurant data using the Facebook Graph API and creates a visual display in the form of a heatmap using the Google Maps Javascript API's visualization layer. We set out to create an alternative to reading restaurant reviews because we really don't like reading restaurant reviews. The Heatery Map immediately shows you all the local "hot spots" and drops markers at the top ten locations, if your into top ten lists...

The algorithm that delivers the results is simplistic and is currently just a proof of concept. The Heatery Map will be a robust source of information once we begin populating the database with more relevant local data.
